Make a creepy old Teddy Ruxpin say whatever you want!

Entering text through the web interface will make Teddy Ruxpin say whatever you want with syncronized mouth movements.

## Introduction

This project was originally based on the [version](https://www.hackster.io/chip/c-h-i-p-py-ruxpin-5f02f1) constructed by the nice folks at NextThing, inc. Unfortunately, it appears as though they and their nifty $9 CHIP have both disappeared into the ether.

So, on that note, I've ported and rebuilt the project for use with a Raspberry Pi.
